<h4> White Alba Truffle: Truffles are expensive items, but none as dear as the Italian white alba version. These items have become difficult to cultivate, thus explaining the exorbitant price. A huge white alba truffle that came in at around 1.51 kilograms was once sold for over $160,000. A retail investor from Hong Kong and his wife brought home the truffle. </h4>
        
        <h5>Almas Caviar: The most expensive of all caviar, and indeed the world's most expensive food is 'Almas', from the Iranian Beluga fish - 1 kg (2 lb 3 oz) of this 'black gold' is regularly sold for £20,000 (then $34,500). Almas is produced from the eggs of a rare albino sturgeon between 60-100 years old, which swims in the southern Caspian Sea where there is apparently less pollution.

Caviar is traditionally eaten directly from the skin between the index finger and the thumb. The eggs are rolled slowly around the mouth and pop to release the flavour. </h5>
        
        <h6>His cheese is the costliest cheese in the world and is available only on demand; this unique cheese strengthens the immune system since it is low in fats and rich in vitamins and proteins. It is made of smoked donkey’s milk and it comes from the milk of a Balkan donkey from Siberia. It takes 25 liters of the donkey's milk to make just one kilogram of the cheese.</h6>
        
        <h7>Head over to Dubai’s Scoopi Café, an ice cream shop now serving the “world’s most expensive ice cream.”

Though Guinness officially lists Serendipity 3’s $25,000 Frrrozen Haute Chocolate ice cream sundae as the world’s most expensive dessert, much of that cost comes from the 18-kt gold and diamond bracelet, that comes on the side, along with the golden spoon.

Scoopi’s “Black Diamond” dessert has a relatively simple Madagascar vanilla bean ice-cream base. But its toppings are where the money is. It's crowned with Italian truffles and rare ambrosial Iranian saffron, which can retail for as much as $100 per ounce. The dessert also has 23-kt edible gold flakes.

        <h8>TOKYO – A black jumbo watermelon auctioned in northern Japan fetched a record $6,100 Friday, making it the most expensive watermelon ever sold in the country — and possibly the world.

The 17-pound premium "Densuke" watermelon, grown only on the northern island of Hokkaido, was purchased by a marine products dealer who said he wanted to support local agriculture, according to Kyodo News agency.

In a country where melons are a luxury item commonly given as gifts, the watermelon's hefty price tag follows another jaw-dropping auction last month, where a pair of "Yubari" cantaloupe melons sold for a record $23,500.

But for watermelon, Friday's winning bid drew a gasp even from veterans of the expensive-fruit market.

"This is the highest price on record for a Densuke watermelon, and that probably means it's the highest of any watermelon in Japanese history," said Kazuyoshi Ohira, a spokesman for the Tohma Agricultural Cooperative in Hokkaido.

The watermelon was the first of 65 sold as part of the season's initial harvest and one of 9,000 expected for the entire year. Unseasonably warm weather in April and May helped boost sugar content and overall quality of the watermelons this year, Ohira said.

Other Densuke watermelons won't cost quite as much. Most will retail at department stores and supermarkets for a more modest 20,000 yen to 30,000 yen $188 to $283, Ohira said.

And what makes a watermelon worth $200, much less $6,000?

Its unusual black skin, Ohira said. Inside, the watermelon is crisp and hard. And, he says, it has unparalleled taste.

"It's a watermelon, but it's not the same," he said. "It has a different level of sweetness."</h8>
